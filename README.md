# Flashcard App with Tkinter

This is a simple Flashcard application built using Python's Tkinter library and the Gemini API to generate flashcards based on a given topic. Users can add custom flashcards, review them, delete individual flashcards or all flashcards, and generate new flashcards automatically with the help of the Gemini API.

## Features

- **Add Flashcards**: Users can create their own flashcards by entering a question and answer.
- **Review Flashcards**: Users can go through their flashcards, one by one, and view the answers.
- **Generate Flashcards with Gemini**: Users can generate flashcards automatically on any topic, specifying the number of flashcards they want.
- **Delete Flashcards**: Flashcards can be deleted individually or all at once.
- **Persistent Storage**: Flashcards are stored in a `flashcards.json` file, ensuring data is saved even when the app is closed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- google-generativeai library (for generating flashcards via Gemini API)

You can install the required library using pip:

```bash
pip install google-generativeai
```

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flashcard-app.git
cd flashcard-app
```

2. Replace the `API_KEY` in the code with your own Gemini API key.

```python
API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
python flashcard_app.py
```

## Screens
