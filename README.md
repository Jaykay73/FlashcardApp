# Flashcard App

A simple and interactive Flashcard App built with **PyQt5** for managing, reviewing, and generating flashcards. The app allows you to manually add flashcards, review them, delete individual or all flashcards, and even generate flashcards automatically using the **Gemini API**.

## Features

- **Add Flashcards**: Create custom flashcards with a question and answer.
- **Review Flashcards**: Randomly review flashcards, with options to:
  - Show the answer.
  - Delete the current flashcard.
- **Generate Flashcards**: Automatically generate flashcards using the Gemini API by providing a topic and the number of flashcards.
- **Delete All Flashcards**: Clear all saved flashcards with a single click (confirmation required).
- **Data Persistence**: Flashcards are saved locally in a JSON file (`flashcards.json`) for later use.
